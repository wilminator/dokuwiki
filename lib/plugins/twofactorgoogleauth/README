A big thanks goes out to Dan Popp for the work on his Google 2FA 
pluginauthgoogle2fa Plugin- it provided me with the idea, libraries, and a 
code template to get this project started.

I make use of the PHP Gangsta Google Authenticator class by 
Michael Kliewe (BSD) and the PHP QR Code library (LGPL3). My thanks to them 
for enabling this plugin to be a reality.
