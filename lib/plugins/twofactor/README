A big thanks goes out to Dan Popp for the work on his Google 2FA

code template to get this project started.

Another big thanks to Christopher Smith and the developers that worked on the 
User Manager pluginUser Manager Plugin. I used their admin code as the basis 
for my plugin and have to give them credit for their work that I used.
